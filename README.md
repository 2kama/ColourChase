# ColourChase
This is a game I built where you could play around with colors. It's actually been converted to an android app using Cordova.

This game is hybrid in nature (i.e built with HTML5, Css and JavaScript).

To get the folder where the game file is: Go to...

"platforms/android/assets/www/"


Hope this helps?
